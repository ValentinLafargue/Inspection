To reproduce the experiments, you can simply clone this repository and install the requierements in a new virtual env as followed:

git clone https://github.com/ValentinLafargue/Inspection.git
cd Inspection
python3 -m venv inspection
source inspection/bin/activate (or ./inspection/Script/activate given your setup)
pip install -r requierements.txt

We compared our results to Stealthily biased sampling paper which uses
- Cmake : https://cmake.org/
- Lemon : [https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/wiki/InstallGuide)
- their repository : https://github.com/sato9hara/stealthily-biased-sampling

Thus to replicate specifically our comparaison with them you will need further instalations (described above).
